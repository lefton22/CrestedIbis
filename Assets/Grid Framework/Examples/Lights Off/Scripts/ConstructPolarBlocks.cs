/*
	ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
	
This script automates the task of placing tiles for the lights-out game
manually. it will loop in a circular fasion through the grid and place tiles
based on ther grid coordinates. Once a tile object has been pu it place
the appropriate components are dded and set up.

For each tile we generate a custom mesh based on the tile's position in
the grid. Every tile has a unique shape, but we can atomate it as well by
using the tile#s grid coordinates to calculate the vertices and onnect them
to triangles. The same mesh is then used for collision as well.

This script demonstrates how to use Grid Framework both for object placement
and for mesh generation. The generated meshed fit together nicely and appear
as one seamless object, but they stay separate.
